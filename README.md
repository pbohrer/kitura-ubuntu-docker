[![Build Status - Develop](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/kitura-ubuntu-docker.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/kitura-ubuntu-docker)


# kitura-ubuntu-docker
Docker image that contains all dependencies for building and running the [Kitura-Starter-Bluemix application](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Starter-Bluemix). Please note that this Docker image extends the [swift-ubuntu-docker](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-ubuntu-docker) image. Hence, this image uses Ubuntu v14.04 (same version found in Cloud Foundry environments, such as Bluemix).
